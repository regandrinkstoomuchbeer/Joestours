              <h3>The City of Dreams</h3>
              <p>
                Famous for its sun, sea and scenery, Cape Town is a beloved tourist destination for visitors the world over. It’s, therefore, no surprise that this coastal gem has been voted the best city in the world seven-years-running! <br><br> From flat-topped Table Mountain down to the blue waters of Table Bay, Cape Town is simply stunning, but the city doesn't thrive by its looks alone. Proudly multicultural, its flourishing arts, dining, and nightlife scenes are proof of this modern metropolis' creativity and innovative spirit. <br><br>The city of Cape Town had its origin in 1652, when the Dutch East India Company established a refreshment station for its ships on the shores of Table Bay. The location was magnificent, on well-watered, fertile soil, beneath the precipitous walls of Table Mountain. The indigenous inhabitants provided cattle but not labour, and the company imported slaves, mainly from East Africa, Madagascar, and the Bay of Bengal area. The slaves brought with them something of their culture and—especially in the case of the Muslims from the East Indies—their religion. Mixed-race unions took place, but strong racial and ethnic characteristics remained. In 1781 the French established a garrison to help the Dutch defend the city against British attack, and the French presence influenced local architecture and culture. British occupation in the 19th century brought new parliamentary and judicial concepts and freedom for the slaves. Cape Town was the gateway to Europe’s penetration of the South African interior, and close ties with continental Europe were maintained.

                    <h3>Table Mountain</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Table Mountain is named Africa’s Leading Tourist Attraction in the World Travel Awards.</p>
                    <p>Table Mountain is the most iconic landmark of South Africa.<br><br>
                      It is also the country’s most photographed attraction and its famous cable car took millions of people to its top.
                      
                      Table Mountain has become the single most welcoming icon to not only our people, but travellers from all over the world.
                      
                      But this mountain hides many surprises that wait to be discovered.<br><br>
                      
                      It is much more than a scenic photograph background or a place from where you can take a breathtaking photo of Cape Town.
                      
                      The easiest option for getting up the mountain is the cableway, which has attracted a whopping 24 million visitors since it first opened in 1929. Significantly revamped in 1997, the cable-cars now carry up to 65 passengers per trip. The journey up the mountain takes about five minutes and the cars rotate through 360 degrees during the trip, giving you spectacular views of the mountain below. </p>

                    <h3>Wine up</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Cape Town is a favourite destination for wine connoisseurs from around the world, and some of the best and oldest wine farms in the region can be found right in the city’s back yard.</p>
                    <p>Cape Town and its surrounds is a world renowned wine region, recognised internationally for its fine wines. While the Cape’s famed winelands have spread to Stellenbosch, Paarl, Franschhoek and beyond, it all began in Constantia, quite literally Cape Town’s back yard. With a wine-making tradition that spans more than 300 years, the Constantia Valley and its surrounds is the oldest wine-producing region in the Southern Hemisphere, its picturesque farms still producing world class, award-winning wines.<br><br>South African wine tourism is centred around the Cape’s award-winning vineyards, the heartland of our sunny country’s wine culture. In this comprehensive guide, we introduce you to the pick of the crop to include in your wine tour in the various geographical wine growing areas while enjoying your exciting holiday in Cape Town.</p>

                    <h3>Cape Point</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Cape Point is a spectacular sight with towering stone cliffs, endemic fynbos, breathtaking bays, beaches and rolling green hills and valleys, just 60km outside Cape Town.</p>
                    <p>Mistakenly cited as the point where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet, Cape Point is, nonetheless, a place like no other. (Incidentally, the two oceans’ meeting point is Cape Agulhas). In a thunderous clash of water against rock, where mountain and ocean meet, Cape Point juts out like an outstretched arm, attracting an incredible diversity of life (furry, feathered and two-legged) to its pristine beaches and rugged cliffs.<br><br>
                      Cape Point promises hikes, swims and historical discoveries, but there’s also a plethora of fauna roaming the park. From baboons carrying their pups on their backs and herds of ostriches strolling about, animal lovers should keep watch, as the reserve is also home to a variety of antelope as well as Cape foxes<br><br> One of the Cape’s most popular tourist destinations – not just because it’s the most southwestern point on the African continent – The Cape of Good Hope also happens to be a spectacularly scenic picnic spot, with a slew of hiking and cycling trails around it. A steep wooden staircase leads to the lookout point, whose 360-degree views are well worth the climb.</p>
